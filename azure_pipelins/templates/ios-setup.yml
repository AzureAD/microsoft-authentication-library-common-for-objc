  inputs:
    # NOTE: If this provisioning profile stops working, follow these steps to
    # regenerate it. Note that the typical iOS_Team_Provisioning_Profile will
    # *NOT* work as that has IsXcodeManaged set to false, so Xcode will ignore
    # it for automatic code-signing.
    # 1. Clear out any provisioning profiles on your local machine by
    # emptying the contents of ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/*
    # (either back them up first or just have Xcode redownload them later).
    # 2. Follow the instructions in the link below to build a dummy project
    # with the com.example bundle-identifer to ensure that profile will work
    # with CMake TryCompile projects
    # https://polly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolchains/ios/bundle-id.html
    # 3. Xcode will now generate a new provisioning profile at
    # ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning Profiles/<UUID>.mobileprovision.
    # Since you deleted all the other profiles in step 1, this should be the
    # only one.
    # 4. Copy it out of that folder, re-name it to match the filename in the
    # 'provProfileSecureFile' property of this task, then upload it to Azure
    # DevOps Secure files.
    provProfileSecureFile: 'iOS_Team_Provisioning_Profile_XcodeManaged.mobileprovision'
